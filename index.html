# Diving in - Hello World Text Component

* The simplest component in React Native - Text

<iframe src="https://snack.expo.dev/embedded/@alavell/react-native-text-component?iframeId=e8edg84lan&amp;preview=true&amp;platform=web&amp;theme=light" height="250px" width="100%" frameborder="0" data-snack-iframe="true" style="display: block;"></iframe> 

---

# Styling - Tailwind

* To layout and style components, we’re going to use twrnc (Tailwind React Native Classes) - a React Native implementation of Tailwind
* Tailwind is a fast way of declaring styles for components with minimal boilerplate 

<iframe src="https://snack.expo.dev/embedded/@alavell/react-native-text-styled?iframeId=gyj1hl4sxk&amp;preview=true&amp;platform=web&amp;theme=light" height="300px" width="100%" frameborder="0" data-snack-iframe="true" style="display: block;"></iframe> 

* Everything in between the tw backticks (note that we’re using backticks - not single quotes!) is tailwind classes, which give you quick access to common styling functionality 

---

# Styling - Tailwind

<iframe src="https://snack.expo.dev/embedded/@alavell/react-native-text-styled?iframeId=gyj1hl4sxk&amp;preview=true&amp;platform=web&amp;theme=light" height="300px" width="100%" frameborder="0" data-snack-iframe="true" style="display: block;"></iframe>

* text-blue-700 sets the text to the color blue-700 (try blue-500, blue-300, etc. for variations) 
* mt-18 sets the margin-top to be 18, pushing the text down 18 units. 
* text-4xl sets the text to be extra large, 4x 

---

# Image

* The React Native Image component is a fundamental building block for displaying images in mobile applications
* It provides a simple and efficient way to incorporate various types of images, including local assets, remote URLs, and base64-encoded images 
<iframe src="https://snack.expo.dev/embedded/@alavell/react-native-image?iframeId=7stcoapwnq&amp;preview=true&amp;platform=web&amp;theme=light" height="300px" width="100%" frameborder="0" data-snack-iframe="true" style="display: block;"></iframe>

---

# View 

* The View in React Native is a fundamental component that is primarily used as a container for other components
* It doesn’t render anything in its foreground, but can take on a shape as well as background colors / images.
<iframe src="https://snack.expo.dev/embedded/@alavell/react-native-view?iframeId=vxcu7tx148&amp;preview=true&amp;platform=web&amp;theme=light" height="300px" width="100%" frameborder="0" data-snack-iframe="true" style="display: block;"></iframe>
* See how in this example we have two Views - one with a background color of black, covering the whole screen, and containing a yellow View with rounded corners

---

# Intro to JavaScript - JS Stats & Platform

* JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, interpreted programming language. 
* JS is on an 11 year streak as the most popular programming language in the 2023 StackOverflow Survey 
* You may be most familiar with JS in the context of the browser, where it’s used to program web pages 
* The magic of the language is that it’s ported to so many different platforms 
* We’ll be using Javascript to code our React Native apps 

---

# Running JS Code (MacOS)

* To best understand JavaScript, you'll want to be able to run JS code on your computer
* Using Homebrew, a package manager for MacOS:  
* <code>brew install node</code> 
* Make a file with the extension (.js) and execute in Terminal: 
* <code>node file.js</code> 

---

# Running JS Code (Windows)

* Download nodeJS from https://nodejs.org/en/Download
* Make a file with the extension (.js) and execute in Console:  
* node file.js 

---

# JS Variables Introduction

* In JavaScript, variables are containers that store data values
* These values can be of various types, including numbers, strings, booleans, objects, arrays, functions, and more 
* Variables in JavaScript are declared using the var, let, or const keywords, followed by the variable name 

---

# JS Variables - const

```js 
const x = 10;
x = 20; // not allowed, will throw error
```

* const is used to declare variables whose values cannot be re-assigned
* This is one of the most common ways you'll see React Native variables declared 

---

# JS Variables - let & var

```js
let x = 10;
x = 20; // allowed

var y = 5;
y = 6; // allowed
```

* let is used to declare variables whose values can be re-assigned - so is var
* So what's the difference? 
* let is distinct from var, in that it has block scope, whereas var has function scope 

---

# JS Blocks

```js
const count = 10;

function x() { // Start block
	const a = 0;
	let b = 1;
	var y = 2;
} // end block
```

* In JavaScript, a block is a set of statements enclosed within a pair of curly braces { }
* Blocks are used to group multiple statements together, and define scope 
* Blocks are generally used in tandem with if statements, function definitions, & loops 

---

# JS scope

* Scope in JavaScript refers to the accessibility and visibility of variables and functions within different parts of the code
* JS has 3 main types of scope: global scope, local scope, and block scope
* Variables declared outside of any function have global scope and can be accessed from anywhere in the code
* Variables declared inside a function have local scope and can only be accessed within that function
* Variables declared with let or const have block scope, and are only visible in the block in which they are declared

---

# JS Functions

* Functions in JS are a way of encapsulating actions, which can read and write data
* Functions are typically declared in one of two ways 
* Method 1: the function keyword
```js
function myFunction() {
	console.log("Hello World");
}
```
* Method 2: arrow functions
```js
const myFunction2 = () => {
	console.log("Hello World");
}
```
* It's common practice in React Native to use the arrow function syntax

---

# Calling (or Executing) JS Functions

* You use the name of the function, followed by parentheses, in order to call the function and execute its logic
```js
const myFunction = () => {
	console.log("Hello World")
}

myFunction() // prints Hello World
```

---

# JS Functions - Parameters

* Functions can accept a list of parameters, which are variables that get assigned values at the time when the function is called
* This is how you pass data into a function
```js
const print = (x) => {
	console.log(x);
}

print("hey") // logs "hey" to the console
```

---

# JS Functions - Returning Values

* In order for a function to give a result, it can do what’s called returning a value
```js
const add2 = (x) => {
	return x + 2;
}

const y = add2(4);
console.log(y); // logs 6 to the console
```
* The add2 function takes any given input value and adds 2 to it
* We can retrieve the returned value by assigning it into a variable at the time when we call the function

---

# JS Arrays

* Arrays are a way of storing data in a sequence
* TODO

---

# JS Map

* TODO

---

# JS Objects

* TODO

---

# JS Conditionals - If

* TODO

---

# JSX Introduction

* JSX (JavaScript XML) is a powerful syntax extension for JavaScript
* JSX fuses markup with Javascript, allowing you to co-locate logic and layout 
* This technique reduces a lot of the boilerplate of other templating systems
* JSX allows developers to write UI components using familiar HTML-like syntax, making it easier to visualize and understand the structure of the UI
* JSX is the glue that holds all React and React Native applications together 
* You will spend much of your time writing JSX

---

# JSX Expressions

* One of the key benefits of JSX is its ability to seamlessly integrate JavaScript expressions and logic within the markup 
* This means that you can embed variables, functions, and conditional statements directly within your JSX code 
* For example, you can use JavaScript expressions within curly braces {} to dynamically generate content
<iframe src="https://snack.expo.dev/embedded/@alavell/react-native-jsx-expressions?iframeId=w8qg3lmdi9&amp;preview=true&amp;platform=web&amp;theme=light" height="280px" width="100%" frameborder="0" data-snack-iframe="true" style="display: block;"></iframe>
* See how the Text element displays the contents of the variable “value”? 
* That’s because the curly braces { } make React evaluate the expression {in between} them, returning the result of expression - in this case, the string stored in the variable “value”

---

# Writing Custom Components 

* Components are a way of packaging and reusing code - write once, use repeatedly! 
* We’ve already seen a handful of common component examples - Text, View & Image 
* These components can be used as building blocks for our own custom components
* Components are defined as JS Functions that return JSX markup
<iframe src="https://snack.expo.dev/embedded/@alavell/react-native-hello-world-component?iframeId=ruov19et0x&amp;preview=true&amp;platform=web&amp;theme=light" height="400px" width="100%" frameborder="0" data-snack-iframe="true" style="display: block;"></iframe>
* Here we define two components, A and B, one shows Text and the other shows an Image
* In the App component we place A and B, notice how we just need the name of the component and all its details are rendered for us

---

# Component Props

* Props (properties) are a means of relaying information from one component to another
* Component Props are similar to Function parameters
* To declare props, use curly braces inside the component function's parameter list:
<iframe src="https://snack.expo.dev/embedded/@alavell/react-native-props-example?iframeId=i59wyr3ii3&amp;preview=true&amp;platform=web&amp;theme=light" height="400px" width="100%" frameborder="0" data-snack-iframe="true" style="display: block;"></iframe>
* Here we define the CustomText component, which accepts “title” as a prop, which it then places in its styled Text component
* See how we reused one component but got three different results!
